                            "Neil Josten is the newest addition to the Palmetto State University Exy team. 
                            He's short, he's fast, he's got a ton of potential—and he's the runaway son of 
                            the murderous crime lord known as The Butcher. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Signing a contract with the PSU Foxes is the last thing a guy like Neil should 
                            do. The team is high profile and he doesn't need sports crews broadcasting 
                            pictures of his face around the nation. His lies will hold up only so long 
                            under this kind of scrutiny and the truth will get him killed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            But Neil's not the only one with secrets on the team. One of Neil's new teammates 
                            is a friend from his old life, and Neil can't walk away from him a second time. 
                            Neil has survived the last eight years by running. Maybe he's finally found 
                            someone and something worth fighting for." - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Foxhole-Court-All-Game-Book-ebook/dp/B00E9BLRUI" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0 link-body-emphasis">official synopsis</a>

                            This is not a good book. But it is my favorite. And, to me, that made it worth 
                            the read. Okay, you know, to say that it isn’t a good book really isn’t fair. 
                            It’s definitely not something I would recommend to just anyone, but it holds an 
                            incredibly special place in my heart. And for that, this series is precious. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Right off the bat, I’m gonna say it: this series reads like a sports anime. As if 
                            a cross between Haikyuu and Banana Fish but with a newly made and wildly popular 
                            fictitious sport. I mean it’s got everything. Drama, romance, college au, team 
                            building, and mafias. What more could you want in a book?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Niel Josten is the epitome of unreliable narrators and poor decision-makers. Low 
                            profile does not mean going to a high-profile school to play a silly little sport 
                            with your childhood friend who is tied to the yakuza family that is hunting you 
                            down. However, I will hand it to him since Kevin Day was somehow fooled by his 
                            disguise of box hair dye and cheap colored contacts. Granted, Kevin was going 
                            through his own personal hell.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the end, Neil does decide to join the exy team of a high-profile university, 
                            Palmetto State University, effectively ignoring his mother’s dying words. 
                            High-profile only because that team is dwindling in performance and constantly 
                            mocked by the college athletics association. Not to mention their historic rivals, 
                            the Edgar Allan Ravens, have joined their district and a fated match looms overhead. 
                            But that’s not all. The son of the Yakuza head who’s tied to his father, a mafia 
                            boss named “the Butcher”, plays for that rival team.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Ravens are the national undefeated champions, but that doesn’t mean the Foxes are 
                            willing to take a beating lying down. With Kevin, a former Raven, as their new 
                            assistant coach, they now have a special mousekatool at their disposal. Now this all 
                            seems like a very good set-up, right? Well, it gets worse. This team has absolutely 
                            zero chemistry and their own personal problems. Many of which they have yet to work 
                            through.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            But that isn’t where it all starts going downhill. No, it begins when Neil decides to 
                            provoke Riko, son of the Yakuza head, on live national television. But his disguise is 
                            so good. Surely this won’t bring about anything bad later. No, of course not. Why would 
                            it? Neil is the poster child of smart, well-thought out decisions. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Despite how much he tries, Neil lets slip little bits of his hidden past. The kicker is 
                            at a banquet, where the Foxes and Ravens are seated near each other and Jean, Kevin, and 
                            Neil end up in private conversation in French. Becuase Neil just casually knows French. 
                            On top of German. And that isn’t the least bit suspicious with his walled-up nature.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            All of this said, as the story progresses, and following the death of one of the Foxes, 
                            they end growing closer as a team. Steadily becoming one solid unit. Neil and Andrew 
                            quietly growing closer to each other than the rest. Until Neil is backed into a corner and 
                            is faced with no other options than to leave the foxes. This is but one of two climaxes in 
                            the final book. Which leads me to my next point. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The last book is so beautifully well-done that I still, to this day, can’t stopping thinking 
                            about how it was structured. The first climax deals with Neil and his father. It’s bloody 
                            and gruesome, but he makes it out. At this point, Neil can no longer hide his true identity 
                            from the other Foxes and is forced to bear all when reunited. After a brief reprieve, allowing 
                            Neil time to heal and momentarily relax, it’s time for the final climax: Foxes vs Ravens. 
                            Neil’s past was one story arc, but exy has always been important to Neil, so it’s no surprise 
                            we have to see the final showdown to the end.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Without a doubt, this is a majorly character-driven story. The plot serves to develop the 
                            characters, mainly Neil. For that reason, it won’t appeal to everyone. Even I don’t tend to 
                            gravitate towards these types of stories. But this one was so done I couldn’t put it down and 
                            ached to reread it as soon as I finished it. All-in-all it was well worth my time, and with 
                            the announcement of another book, I’m already planning my next reread.
