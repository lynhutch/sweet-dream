                            "As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn’t believe in lasting romantic 
                            relationships–but her best friend does, and that’s what got her into this situation. 
                            Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was 
                            always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. 
                            So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she 
                            sees. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            That man is none other than Adam Carlsen, a young hotshot professor–and well-known 
                            ass. Which is why Olive is positively floored when Stanford’s reigning lab tyrant 
                            agrees to keep her charade a secret and be her fake boyfriend. But when a big science 
                            conference goes haywire, putting Olive’s career on the Bunsen burner, Adam surprises 
                            her again with his unyielding support and even more unyielding…six-pack abs.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Suddenly their little experiment feels dangerously close to combustion. And Olive 
                            discovers that the only thing more complicated than a hypothesis on love is putting 
                            her own heart under the microscope." - <a href="https://alihazelwood.com/the-love-hypothesis/" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0 link-body-emphasis">official synopsis</a>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This was written for STEM girlies by a STEM girly. Even though I’m not a science 
                            person this still had me kicking my feet. The actual biology talk didn’t even go 
                            too in depth so I didn’t feel absolutely clueless reading this. It’s not a 
                            ground-breaking story, but it’s a niche romance we need more of. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This book stands as evidence to support MY hypothesis: fanfic writers who pursue 
                            publication make great books. Sure some parts of this book made it obvious that 
                            this story was once a fanfic, but did I care? No, absolutely not. During a period 
                            of sparse reading, I devoured this book. I giggled and kicked my feet and rolled 
                            around on my bed during each and every cute little interaction between Olive and 
                            Adam.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One thing about me is that I love a good fake-dating trope. Depending on its 
                            execution, its the perfect recipe for tension so thick you’d have to be jellyfish 
                            to not notice it. All of these little moments building up until they finally boil 
                            over in one very long, very detailed chapter. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now this book might focus on biology, but these character’s have undeniable 
                            chemistry. It’s so good that I’m willing to ignore the miscommunication trope 
                            sprinkled in.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Adam is notorious for his cold and blunt attitude towards his students, but its a 
                            common case of “sweet to the one he actually cares about.” Which I am always weak 
                            to when it comes to a romance.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            But navigating a fake relationship isn’t the only thing this book has to offer.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One thing this book handled really well was the fear every woman harbors: 
                            predatory men in the workplace. Being led to believe the opportunity you’ve been 
                            waiting for is finally within reach, but the one dangling it over you head as 
                            attached an ulterior motive. And you can’t have one without giving the other. In a 
                            perfect world, this would never happen, but even this story can’t exist in a perfect 
                            world. The ending, however, is exactly what should happen in every case.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Despite the stories origins, which is something many in the publishing industry are 
                            trying to repaint, it’s truly a wonderfully written romance. And one I want to 
                            revisit soon.
