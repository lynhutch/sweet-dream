                            <br>
                            This series single-handedly pulled me out of a years long book slump. I ate up 
                            each and every book. Honestly, I can’t remember the last time I devoured a 
                            series like this (that’s a lie, it was 2020 and I was reading All For the Game). 
                            This was such a tumultuous journey. So let’s just dive right in.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Xie Lian went from god-pleasing crown prince to the laughing stock of the three 
                            realms. But how? Well, I guess you could call it a series of unfortunate events. 
                            Seriously, will he ever catch a break between his abysmal luck and his magnetism 
                            for humiliation (some instances are entirely his own sacrifice, though at the 
                            rate of occurrence it makes one wonder if he’s secretly a masochist). I won’t 
                            delve too deeply into the events leading to his downfall, but I will touch on 
                            some events afterward.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Beginning with the first arc to truly have me gripping my kindle in anticipation 
                            for each next page: the Black Water Arc. This one doesn’t really revolve around 
                            Xie Lian, but another of my favorite characters in the series: Shi Qingxuan. A 
                            lively character, the wind master, a four famous tales, and a fate stealer. 
                            Though the latter isn’t his fault. Now, I should have known something was fishy 
                            (no pun intended) from the moment I found out Shi Qingxuan and his brother, Shi 
                            Wudu, both ascended within a close time frame. Siblings ascending certainly is 
                            something of awe, but should not be fated or chalked up to mere coincidence. And 
                            it was neither. This arc’s twists felt endless, and even as they kept slapping 
                            me in the face I held onto the pitiful hope that something or someone would appear 
                            and nothing bad would happen. What a naive girl I was. He Xuan’s confrontation 
                            with the Shi brothers was an absolute nightmare for someone who loves Shi Qingxuan. 
                            I didn’t even care all that much for Shi Wudu, but I still felt for him at the 
                            end of that confrontation. The worst part was being left wonder whether Shi 
                            Qingxuan made it out of there alive. (Which I later found out, yes, but at what 
                            cost? The answer: an arm and a leg. Literally. Sort of.)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The second arc to have me gripping the edge of my seat was post-Xie Lian’s first 
                            banishment. Following the downfall of Xianle and all the horrors that led up to 
                            that point, Xie Lian went from knowing nothing but a life of a luxury to scraping 
                            together what meager funds he could from pawning his prized sword collection and 
                            working odd jobs. The beginning of this back story arc had one quote I read from 
                            Osamu Dazai flitting through my mind: “Love flies out the window when poverty walks 
                            in the door.” Although the events of this arc are not a literal interpretation of 
                            this quote, it felt fitting. Taking care of not only himself and his two close 
                            friends who followed him to the heavens, but his parents—the former king and queen 
                            of Xianle. Mu Qing was the first to leave. Which began Xie Lian’s dark spiral until 
                            he pushed Feng Xin into leaving too, after the return of White No-Face, the one who 
                            had brought the destruction of his kingdom. It wasn’t long until his parents left 
                            him too, in a most gruesome way, leading to the birth of his spiritual device. 
                            However, his dark spiral was the most captivating part of this arc. Watching him 
                            slowly become the creature he despised, right down to the same half crying, half 
                            smiling mask. He’d lost everything and suffered something worse than death, and 
                            focused that anger on the people he believed caused it: Yong’an. He intended to 
                            inflict the same curse upon Yong’an that had plagued Xianle in its final days. But 
                            changed his mind after receiving a bamboo hat from a stranger in the rain. This is 
                            very trimmed-down version of events, for the sake of withholding as many spoilers 
                            as possible. Needless to say, receiving that bamboo hat salvaged what remained of 
                            Xie Lian’s humanity. Thus began eight-centuries of scrap-collecting.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now let’s talk about Hua Cheng. Second male lead, love interest, ghost king, 
                            stalker, sculptor. Notoriously bad at calligraphy. Every time the characters ended 
                            up in a tight pinch I always found myself hoping that he’d appear. And 95% of the 
                            time he did. However, his appearance was always for the sake of Xie Lian, he really 
                            could not careless about the well-being of anyone else involved. In the end, he’d 
                            help them for Xie Lian’s sake and no other reason. That said, his raw power isn’t 
                            what makes him such an interesting character, but rather his unwavering devotion 
                            and, at first, odd inclination toward Xie Lian. It makes one wonder what happened 
                            in the last eight centuries to have a ghost king so fond of a twice-banished god. 
                            As the story unravels and pasts are revealed, you really can’t help but want to see 
                            those two get their happy ending. Hua Cheng really is sweet only to Xie Lian during 
                            the course of their slow burn romance, and a far bit teasing. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Talk about a slow burn romance. Six books until they confess their feelings to each 
                            other in a cave full statutes one carved of the other. Six whole books of them 
                            flirting and finding excuses to kiss. I love a good slow-burn, don’t get me wrong, 
                            but if I’m going to wait this long for two characters who obviously have feelings for 
                            each other confess, I better get just as much content of them being all lovey-dovey. 
                            I jest. Mostly. It would always be nice to get more content of them post-confession. 
                            Not even just domesticity, but just running rampant around the world. Yet alas, every 
                            story must come to an end and I rather it end on a happy note. Which is the hope I’m 
                            clinging to after that cliffhanger in volume 7.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now, while all of the above have made the reading of this series worthwhile, what got 
                            me interested in this series in the first place? One simple quote that stumbled upon 
                            long before I ever heard of Heaven Official’s Blessing: Body in abyss, heart in 
                            paradise. At first glance, it might just seem like any other cool quote, and that’s 
                            exactly what it was to me at first encounter. However, it serves as the catalyst for 
                            the whole plot. The body endures many hardships, some even that could be considered 
                            horrors, yet the heart—or soul—remain pure and in a state of content. One’s beliefs 
                            hold strong in the face of turmoil, be it internal or external. As I continued reading, 
                            that quote always in the back of my mind, it became clearer with each page how perfectly 
                            it fits Xie Lian as a character. That alone makes this series something I will never 
                            regret picking up. A character like him, tied to a quote like that, makes for an 
                            unforgettable story.
