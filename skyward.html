                            "Spensa’s world has been under alien attack for decades. Pilots are the heroes 
                            of what’s left of humanity, and becoming a pilot is Spensa’s dream. Ever since 
                            she was a little girl, Spensa has dreamed of soaring skyward and proving her 
                            bravery. But her father’s legacy stands in the way—he was a pilot who was 
                            killed for desertion years ago, branding Spensa the daughter of a coward, and 
                            making her chances of attending flight school slim to none.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Spensa is still determined to fly—even if it means she must be as resilient in 
                            the face of long odds as humanity itself has had to be against the alien threat. 
                            And her accidental discovery in a long forgotten cavern might just grant her a 
                            way to claim the stars." - <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/skyward-series/" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0 link-body-emphasis">official synopsis</a>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <u>This review contains spoilers. Please proceed carefully.</u>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My dad has spoken quite fondly of Sanderson’s works, namely the Stormlight 
                            Archive and the Wheel of Time, which he took over after the passing of Robert 
                            Jordan (known to me only because of my dad). So when I saw this on the shelf 
                            at Barnes and Noble, I figured it’d be a good place to start with science 
                            fiction, a genre I’m not all too familiar with. Sanderson did a wonderful job 
                            in getting me to like an unlikeable character. And the MAIN character at that. 
                            While I did find Spensa a bit on the annoying and possibly abrasive side, I 
                            still couldn’t help but root for her and want to see her realize her dream. 
                            M-bot was a darling addition to the story and really highlighted, to me, 
                            Sanderson’s storytelling. He has a brilliant way of balancing characters, plot, 
                            and world building. It feels neither is favored more than another. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Though to be fair to Spensa’s arguably atrocious personality, she has lived 
                            years under constant ridicule after her father was named “Coward of the Century.” 
                            (This might be an embellishment on my part.) But a daughter who always looked up 
                            to her father, who had once been the star pilot of the DDF, it’s no surprise 
                            she’d react the way she does when people drag his name through the mud. Labeled 
                            a “Coward’s Daughter” she wants to become a DDF pilot just like her father. One, 
                            because she dreams of flying, and two, to prove she’s better than what everyone 
                            claims her to be. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            If she wasn’t Spensa, she likely would have given up ages ago. But armed with her 
                            fortuitous personality and haughty air, she actually manages to squeeze her way 
                            into flight school. Yet of course, it’s never that easy. She’s faced with more 
                            than a few hiccups and her already tiny class grows smaller long before graduation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It eventually leads to the point, where she’s faced with only the options of 
                            ejecting or dying, she’s kicked out for choosing the former. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This won’t stop her from flying, though. Along the way, in a Disney Princess fashion, 
                            she gains companions in the forms of an AI-powered ship named M-Bot (short for 
                            Mushroom-Bot, according to it) and a teleporting slug name Doomslug. Together with 
                            the power of friendship (and many stole ship parts) she saves the day in a battle 
                            with the Krell (effectively defying orders and breaking a few laws but that’s beside 
                            the point). 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            During time at flight school, she also finds out more about her father’s defect, and 
                            it’s harsh truth. Hearing the stars and turning against his flightmates. But in that 
                            last battle where she joins the fray, Spensa hears the same thing her father did: the 
                            stars. She’s about to meet his same fate, but she’s equipped with M-Bot, who’s able 
                            to save her from going down that same path. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            There was one scene that reminded me of Tatsuki Fujimoto and Gege Akutami. That one 
                            scene landed Sanderson a place in my list of “Evil Authors I Aspire to Be.” It was 
                            that jaw-droppingly out of pocket. So far out of left field I had sit in silence for 
                            a long moment and reflect on what I just endured.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            All in all, this was such a ride of a story, and that should say something given I 
                            don’t tend to read Sci-Fi. From the wonderful cast of characters (even the fleshed 
                            out side-characters) and the toe-dipping introduction to what is doubtless going to 
                            be complex worldbuilding, this has quickly earned it’s way to one of my favorite 
                            reads.
