                            "Also known as Let Me Eat Your Pancreas, this deeply moving first-person story 
                            is about a high school boy who finds the diary of his classmate—and discovers 
                            that she’s dying. Yamauchi Sakura has been silently suffering from a pancreatic 
                            disease in school, and now exactly one person outside her family knows. He 
                            swears to her that he won’t tell anyone what he learned, and the shared secret 
                            brings them closer together. The two have very little in common, but they find 
                            themselves drawn to each other in Sakura’s final months to live." - <a href="https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/i-want-to-eat-your-pancreas-manga/" class="link-underline link-underline-opacity-0 link-body-emphasis">official synopsis</a>

                            I know how that title sounds but trust me there’s no cannibalism in this. It 
                            actually left me so emotionally moved I still tear up when I think about it. But 
                            first, let me give some backstory.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Early 2021, 3am, my bedroom. My sleep schedule? An absolute nightmare. I decide 
                            to watch a little movie called I Want to Eat Your Pancreas. What could go wrong? 
                            (So much). It’s going well, and then I decide to make hard boiled eggs. I make 
                            it to the last 30 minutes of the movie with my hard boiled eggs in my lap and 
                            tears streaming down my face. I pause the movie because I don’t want my tears to 
                            over-salt my eggs. I never finish the movie. And I still, to this day, haven’t 
                            watched the last 30 minutes. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A year later, though, I did pick up the manga. And sobbed my way through the whole 
                            thing. How else was supposed to read it when I knew what was coming and feared what 
                            came after?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A girl who keeps her sickness under tightly sealed lips, and a boy who accidentally 
                            discovers what she hides. It’s a weight lifted off her shoulders. She finally has 
                            someone she doesn’t have to hide from. Sakura doesn’t want her friends to know she’s 
                            dying. So when this introverted boy in her class finds out, she drags him along to 
                            fill what remains of her days with little adventures.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It’s a friendship steeped in an underlying sadness. A boy who never cared about his 
                            classmates, and a cheerful dying girl. Both of whom come to appreciate the presence 
                            of the other. Forming a bond neither expected.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Until one night when her death came sudden and tragic, unlike the one they all knew 
                            was looming just around the corner. I remember feeling my stomach drop, both when 
                            watching and reading the scene. They made plans. Another little adventure. One that 
                            would now never happen.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This boy, whose name we still don’t know at this point in the story, now has to 
                            grapple with the loss of new first friend. He had prepared himself to lose her to 
                            her disease, but to something unexpected like murder.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Yet, by far, the most prominent scene in the story, is when the boy goes to Sakura’s 
                            mom after her funeral. He gives his condolences, she gives him a message from Sakura. 
                            And then he asks her if he can cry now. All this time he waited for permission. Feeling 
                            as though he didn’t deserve to grieve for someone he hadn’t known for long. Like his 
                            place in her life was insignificant. When truthfully, he always had the right to mourn her.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To this day, this book has hung in the back of my mind, sticking with me all its lessons in 
                            mortality. This is one book that I would recommend to everyone.
